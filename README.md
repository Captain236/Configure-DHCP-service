# Configure-DHCP-service

**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) – Automated IP Address Management DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, and DNS settings to devices on a network. This eliminates the need for manual IP configuration, ensuring efficient and conflict-free network management.**

Key Benefits:

**✅ Automated IP Assignment – Reduces manual configuration and errors.**

**✅ Efficient IP Management – Dynamically allocates and reclaims unused IP addresses.**

**✅ Scalability – Ideal for networks with a large number of devices.**

**✅ Centralized Control – Simplifies administration with a dedicated DHCP server.**

## Summary
**In this project, I installed and configured the DHCP protocol on Windows Server. I created an IP address pool, allowing the DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses to client machines, ensuring efficient and dynamic network management.**
